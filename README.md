# [My-TextApp](https://mytextapp.netlify.app/)

## This is my first project in ReactJS.

* In this project you can convert the input text either to uppercase or to lowercase.
* You can also remove extra spaces from the text.
* With this app you can also copy the text.

## I have created my project in different modes.
